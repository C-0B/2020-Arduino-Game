# INS: Instructions



When started, the game will display a welcoming screen asking the user to "Press any button". To
continue, press any of the 5 buttons and release, if multiple are pressed at the same time then the
game will proceed once all buttons have been released.



Next the main menu will be displayed which has 3 options:

1. Practice - A one off level which the user can select the difficulty, after a single round it will
return to the main menu


2. Story - A mode that gets more difficult as you progress though the levels, one incorrect reponse
will end the game and will return to the main menu. High scores in this mode can be saved.



3. Hi-Score - Will display the current high score with a 3 character reference of the player (press

any button to return to the main menu).



Use the up and down buttons to switch between the modes, the menu is non-looping eg. going down from

1 will not cycle to option 3. Press and release the select button to choose a mode.





Practice:



Once the practice mode has been selected and after a short wait time (about 1 second), the user will

be asked to select a sequence length from 4 to 16(N), this can be done using the up and down buttons

to increment or decrement the value displayed. The select button can be pressed to proceed. Next the

user can select how many different symbols could appear in the sequence, 2 to 4 (M). This can also

be changed with the up and down buttons and using select to confirm. Then a 3 second count down will

start and the level will be played. A sequence of length N with M possible characters will be

generated and displayed to the user one symbol at a time. The user will then be asked to "Copy the

symbols". The sequence entered by the user will be displayed on the second line of the LCD. To reply

to the sequence use the directional buttons to indicate which symbol you want and then press select

to submit your choice for that position You will then be able to select the symbol for the next

position. Once you have confirmed a symbol for a position you cannot go back and change it. By

default an up arrow will be shown in each position in the reply to start. Once enough symbols have

been entered the game will either say "FAILIURE" with a red backlight, or "SUCCESS" with a green

back light for a short time before returning to the main menu.





Story:



When the story mode is selected before each round is begun a level number will be shown to the user

indicating which level they have just started (starting from 0). The mode will start from a sequence

length of 4, number of symbols 2 and time between characters in the sequence to be 1 second. As

levels progress the time between characters will decrease to half a second, the number of possibles

in the sequence will grow up to 4 and the length of the sequence will grow up to 16.



The game will get progressively harder as each level is completed. The game gets harder by first

decreasing the amount of time each symbol is shown on the screen for the user to remember, then the

number of possible symbols increased. Once all the possible variations of possible symbols and time 

have been used, the length of the sequence is increased and the number of possibles is set to 2 and

the time between symbols is set back to 1 second.



This repeats up to sequences of length 16 with 4 possible symbols and half a second between each

symbol is shown. A maximum score can be achieved by reaching level 78. The way the user enters the

symbols to replicate the sequence is the same as the practice mode.





High Score:



When the third option is selected from the menu the LCD will display the current high score and

who got that score. To go back to the menu press and release any button.
